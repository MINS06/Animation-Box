# Animation Box
 
This tool is not finished at all. If you still want to download the code to improve on it, go ahead.

1) create a hitboxData asset
2) create a custom animation asset
3) Open the Animation-Box: Tools/AnimationBox

Things you could add:
- time line that shows a dot for every hitbox on each frame. 
- A selection to switch between different animation types:
	1) type one plays animations based on time (standart)
	2) type two plays animation based on any variable. (e.g. if you have a jump animation you often want to 							        play frames based on y-velocity)
- select and copy / paste hitboxes across frames
- apply a hitbox to all frames directly.
- delete hitboxes.
- or anything else you can think of.

I would love to get a copy of your improved system :)
